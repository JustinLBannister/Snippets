        <li>Tenure: Coming up for 2 years at RBC, 15+ years in industry having trained as a chartered accountant</li>
        <li>Role: I'm a FIG banker so my job is to provide strategic advice (particularly around M&A) to insurance companies</li>
        <li>First and dream car: I have yet to own a car having moved to London from the Celtic fringes aged 18 for university but passed my test within the past few years to be better able to facilitate my children's social calendars. The first car I drove was my wife's X3 where I purchased short term insurance from Veygo which represented excellent business for Admiral as its fair to say I received real-time reminders of the importance of careful driving!</li>
        <li>Fun fact / hobby: I'm a keen golfer, although it's a more difficult hobby to pursue living in London with a young family</li>

        <li>Tenure: I have been in investment banking for over 20 years; clearly the best 11 years of which were as Admiral's broker at UBS.</li>
        <li>Role: My job is to ensure Admiral is the centre of my and RBC's attention; both the obvious areas but also those that aren't. I will wake up thinking of ways to better promote Admiral's interests and go to bed reviewing what missed and can do better.</li>
        <li>First and dream car: My first car was a bright red 1 litre polo that did not like steep hills. Not straying far from my stereotype, my dream car is a fully kitted out and restored classic LWB '90s Range Rover.</li>
        <li>Fun fact / hobby: I ran the 2019 London Marathon with a bust knee (that's my excuse) for my daughter's T1D charity. Geraint was in same race - just pipping me at an hour quicker...</li>
