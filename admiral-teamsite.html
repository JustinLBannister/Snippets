    <ul>
      <li>Tenure: I have been at RBC for nearly 13 years and have been leading our exciting European Capital Markets business since November 2024. I am also responsible for RBCs Global Markets Sales teams globally.</li>
      <li>Role: Over the past decade RBC has invested and is investing significant resources into our European business. We have grown materially over the last few years and I am extremely proud of progress we have made. I am especially focussed on ensuring our businesses are aligned around our clients, ensuring we build strong client partnerships and deliver the best advice, service, resources and solutions from across the whole bank. Admiral epitomises the kind of client we want to work with.</li>
      <li>First and dream car: My first car was a rather beaten up silver Mini that I inherited from my elder sister. I dream of a Bentley Continental GT - sadly given I have three children, a slobbery dog and live in a road with width restrictions that test the driving skills of a Fiat 500 owner, it will remain a dream.</li>
      <li>Fun fact / hobby: I used to do three day eventing and still love to horse ride, but rarely get the chance to do so other then when on holiday.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Tenure: Will be 30 years this Sept in the industry and I have now done 14 years at RBC</li>
      <li>Role: My job is to run the European FIG franchise at RBC but I will never forget my heritage is as a Corporate Broker and ECM banker in the Financials sector. As such I still think the best part of my job is advising companies, exec and boards on all aspects. I led the team on Direct Line from float to the sale to Aviva which presented a pretty wide array of interesting situations – both good news and plenty of less good news! We have an outstanding team who have real experience in this sub-sector and I know we can smash it for you!</li>
      <li>First and dream car: My first car was a very beaten up Mitsubishi Shogun on the farm I grew up on, it had moss growing between the windows. I am lucky to own my dream car – a 1954 Landrover Series 1 albeit I still hanker after a DB5</li>
      <li>Fun fact / hobby: This links to the last point, I have a nasty habit of collecting Landrovers and have a series 1, series 2a, series 3, 2005 TD5 and one of the newer defenders</li>
